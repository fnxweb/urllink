    <h2><img src="chrome://urllink/content/urllink.png" alt="logo">&nbsp;&nbsp;URL Link</h2>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
    Select some text, in a web-page, text-input (web form) or email, and
    right-click.
    <ul>
      <li>
      If the text looks like a URL, you'll be able to directly open it (or into
      a tab) via “Open Selection”.
      </li>
      <li>
      If the text <i>doesn't</i> look like a link, you will get a sub-menu
      allowing it to be treated as a link anyway, or perform some customisable
      conversion first (<i>e.g.</i>, add “www.” and “.com”).
      </li>
      <li>
      Under preferences, where you can customise the sub-menu that appears, you
      can add your own separators with entries consisting solely of hyphens,
      for example: <tt>"--"</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
      Custom menu entries may contain any URL, nomatter how long, with the
      first '*' being replaced by the selection.  You may have a nickname
      before a bar '|' in the entry to shorten what appears in the menu:<br>
      <tt>"Short name|http://www.longname.com/q=*"</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
      In Firefox, hold down &lt;Shift&gt; when selecting 'Open' to open in a new
      window instead of using the current window.
      </li>
      <li>
      You may choose whether URL Link places its option near the top or the
      bottom of the standard context menu via a preference.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Functionality</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
      URL Link is a small Firefox and Thunderbird extension that allows you to
      select a non-URL in a mail/news message or web-page, and open it in a
      browser window.
      </li>

      <li>
      For emails, it reconnects links in emails which have been broken across
      several lines, and also replaces spaces with the URL character code %20
      so that you may follow emailed network `file:' links (which it
      auto-detects from Windows X: or UNC network references).
      </li>

      <li>
      For web pages, it also allows you to select textual links/URLs in web
      pages or edit boxes, and follow them as if they were real links. It will
      always let you follow links and also analyses mailto: links.
      </li>

      <li>
      It breaks down `mailto:' links (converts, e.g.,
      mailto:someone@somesite.com to http://www.somesite.com), so you may visit
      a related website.
      </li>

      <li>
      It can `follow' javascript: links that would otherwise generate a pop-up
      (e.g., http://www.kelkoo.co.uk/ - although they've recently changed some
      of their links so that URL Link fails :-( I hope to work on that post
      2.0).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Forthcoming changes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
      Customisable auto-replacement of text with URLs.
      </li>
      <li>
      Maybe allowing some of the customised sub-menu items to be promoted to
      the main menu.
      </li>
    </ul>
